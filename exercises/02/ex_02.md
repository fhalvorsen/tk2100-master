# Exercise 02

Using the `lesson02_example.html` file as a template 
(i.e., a starting point to modify), create an HTML page in which you can
"encode" and "decode" a message using a substitution cipher.
So, in the page you will have a textarea to input your text, one textarea to 
show the result (encoded or decoded), and three buttons: to encode,
decode or clear the textareas.

The substitution cipher should do a char shift of +7 values.
So, when you encode the string "abc" you should get "hij".
When encoding "{Hello!!!}", you should get "$Olssv(((&".

To get the char code from the first char in a string, in JavaScript use
the function `.charCodeAt(0)`.
To convert from char code `x` to string, use `String.fromCharCode(x)`.

Note: be careful to consider only chars in the range 33-126. Chars outside
such range should be ignored, i.e. kept the same.
To avoid overflows (i.e., a value that goes above 126), you will need to use
the module operator `%`.
