# Exercise 03

If you are using Windows, install GitBash from [http://gitforwindows.org/](http://gitforwindows.org/).
On the other hand, if using Mac/Linux, just use the existing Bash terminal.

By **only** using the Bash terminal, create a new folder where you copy
over your solution of the previous exercise, i.e. the `lesson02_solution.html` file.
Change the name of the file into `index.html`.
You will likely need to use Bash commands like 
`pwd`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `ls`, `mv` and `cp`.

If you do not have it yet, install Docker (Community Edition) on your machine
(e.g., see [https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download)).
If you are using Windows Home Edition, you might need to upgrade
it first (e.g., to Educational or Pro version).
If you are a student at Westerdals/Kristiania, you should be able 
to get free Windows upgrades. 

In the newly created folder with the html file, create a file
called `Dockerfile` by using `touch`.
Open such file in a text editor.
In such Dockerfile, configure it to use OS image from `httpd:2.4`.
This image contains an Apache Server.
Inside this Docker image, `COPY` your `index.html` file under the
folder `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/`.

From the folder with the `Dockerfile`, build this Docker image with:

`docker build -t foo .`


Run such Docker image with:

`docker run -p 80:80 foo`

If everything is correct, you should be able to open your browser
at the URL `localhost` and see your html page.   

Regarding Docker, solutions (i.e., the `Dockerfile`) to this exercise can be found under the
`solutions/03` folder.
